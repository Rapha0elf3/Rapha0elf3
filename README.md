## Hi there! Welcome to my profile    

My name is Raphael and i am current studying Systems Development at Senai. I always have liked computers and programming is satisfactory for me, so I decided to take a step further and do a tecnical course about it.

<br>

Senai is giving me more than I could imagine. the teachers teach you not just about programming tecniques, but also the knowledge to become a professional. The way of thinking, the steps you have to take to to start a project, etc.

With all of that in mind, I plan on becoming a full-stack programmer focused on the development of softwares and/or websites. Seeing my creations come to life brings me joy and fullfilment and I want to work with that.
