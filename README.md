Hi there! Welcome to my profile    

My name is Raphael and i am current studying Sistems Development at Senai. 
I always have liked computers and programming is satisfactory for me, so I 
decided to take a step further and do a tecnical course about it.

Senai is giving me more than I could imagine. the teachers teach you not just
about programming tecniques, but also the knowledge to become a professional. 
The way of thinking, the steps you have to take to to start a project, etc.

The main tecnology I am learning this semester is Javascript, but I already know 
the basics of HTML and CSS, witch will be covered next semester.

With all of that in mind, I plan on becoming a full-stack programmer focused on 
the development of softwares and/or websites. Seeing my creations come to life 
brings me joy and fullfilment and I want to work with that.
